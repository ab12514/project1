    "One of the main ways free apps make money is through in-app ads. In order to maximize revenue for these apps, the number of users should be maximized as well. With that being said, our goal for this project will be to act as data analysts for a company that focuses on building free English iOS and Android apps and analyze data in order to better understand what type of apps attract more users. We will be looking into some apps on Google Play and the App Store to help us accomplish this goal.\n"

Thus, it would be a good idea to combine these two types of genres and make a finance based utility app.\n",
